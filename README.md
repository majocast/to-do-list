# To Do List

## Description:
A basic To-Do list application that allows users to add, modify, and delete tasks that they have to complete in their day-to-day lives. The To-Do list gives a sleek display that is easily manageable and auto-updating according to the commands the user gives. This application was created as a means of refreshing my memory on DOM manipulation via JavaScript.
